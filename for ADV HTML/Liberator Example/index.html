            <h1>Blake's 7 Liberator</h1>
            <p>This is the spaceship from the BBC television programme Blake's 7, which
            was shown on BBC between 1978 and 1881. The finale of season four featured
            the death of every principle character. The Liberator was a stolen spaceship of
            alien origin. It was destroyed at the end of the third series.</p>
